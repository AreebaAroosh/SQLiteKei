#SQLite Kei
##Description
SQLite Kei is a database management tool for SQLite databases. It started out as a side project for me to learn different technologies.

##Planned Features
- Manage multiple databases simultaneously
- Search tables and view data
- Create/Rename/Delete/Copy tables
- Write queries to your database using an internal query editor
- and more

##Technical infos & Technologies used
- C# on .NET Framework 4.5.2
- WPF
- SQLite

##Trivia
- About the project name: I was looking for a working title and noticed that all the cool stuff like Manager, Management, Studio, Administrator, etcetera all were in use already. Since I like to use random Japanese words as working titles for my projects I picked the Japanese Kanji ç³» (written as 'kei') which means "system".
- I organize myself using Taiga.io, an open source project management tool that supports Scrum and Kanban styled procedures. It's a really neat tool, you should check it out.
